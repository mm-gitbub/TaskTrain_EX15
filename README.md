# TaskTrain_EX15
QA Engineering Externship with TaskTrain | May 2025 - July 2025
Hosted by TripleTen

Project Description
This repository showcases the QA work I completed during a hands-on externship with TaskTrain, a Boston-based SaaS startup founded by Keith Gillette in 2018. TaskTrain helps organizations streamline recurring workflows and SOPs using a checklist-driven platform.

Over the course of the project, I worked closely with a team of 11 QA Engineers to validate key product features. Our responsibilities included planning and executing sprints in Jira, performing exploratory and regression testing, reviewing Gherkin-based feature files, and logging bugs with clear reproduction steps. We used tools like Discord and Google Docs for seamless team collaboration and communication throughout the Agile Scrum process.
