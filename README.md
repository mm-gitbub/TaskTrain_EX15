# TaskTrain_EX15
QA Engineering Externship with TaskTrain | May 2025 - July 2025
Hosted by TripleTen

Project Description
This repository showcases the QA work I completed during a hands-on externship with TaskTrain, a Boston-based SaaS startup founded by Keith Gillette in 2018. TaskTrain helps organizations streamline recurring workflows and SOPs using a checklist-driven platform.

Over the course of the project, I worked closely with a team of 11 QA Engineers to validate key product features. Our responsibilities included planning and executing sprints in Jira, performing exploratory and regression testing, reviewing Gherkin-based feature files, and logging bugs with clear reproduction steps. We used tools like Discord and Google Docs for seamless team collaboration and communication throughout the Agile Scrum process.

💻 My Key Responsibilities:
Exploratory Testing,
Zapier Integration Testing,
Gherkin-Based Manual Testing,
Bug Reporting & Regression Testing,
Cross-Browser Testing,
Heuristic UX/UI Audit

🧰 Tools We Used:
TaskTrain – Application under test,
Jira – Sprint planning and bug tracking,
DrivT – Test case management,
Zapier – Integration testing,
Google Docs / Sheets – Documentation & reporting,
Slack, Discord, Notion – Third-party integration testing,
GitHub – Version control,
VS Code – GitHub Integration

📊 Project Outcomes:
Total Test Cases: 858,
Test Case Pass Rate: 78%,
Test Case Failure Rate: 15%,
Bugs Reported: 126

👩‍💻 My Contributions:
Writing 97 test cases, covering multiple areas of functionality,
